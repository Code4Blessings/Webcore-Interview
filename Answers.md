## Frontend Questions
1. A company needs you to make their website more accessible. What are some of the first things you consider?

4. Changes to state that should affect the rendering of a stateful React component aren’t updating the component as expected. What could be causing this issue? 

Answer:

```
A number of things could be causing the issue such as; user activity, API requests not written properly, or even network activity.  I'd also check the initial states and set States to make sure what type of state it is --an array, a string, or and object?

```


5. Why should we use Proptypes in React?

Answer:

```
Props is an argument that react takes in for the purpose of passing down data dynamically from the parent component down to its children.  This enables the developer to use less code and follow the principle of DRY.

```
For an example click [here](https://github.com/Code4Blessings/team-builder/blob/robin-warden/src/App.js)

6. A company has a website that currently renders very badly on tablets and mobile devices. You’ve been tasked to make the site responsive. How will you go about this?

Answer:

```
I would look at the website and shrink it to the size of a mobile phone using the window resizer extension, on chrome to get the exact dimensions of a mobile phone.  Then I would examine the site to see which parts of it do not fit in the screen.  Whatever doesn't fit well will have a media query applied in order to make the text and the images fit properly.

7. When should you opt to use a stateless component vs a stateful component in React? 

Answer:

```
A stateless component is one that has no changes or functionality.  For example, when we pass down data and want to identify which part of the data has an h1 tag, or a p tag, then we would make use of a stateless component.  In the case of a component that will have changes and/ or functionality, we would invoke a stateful component.  An example for this would be a form
